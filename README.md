## About

This crate is an implementation of the [Package URL](https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec)
specification for the [Rust](http://rust-lang.org/) programming language.

## 🔌 Usage

Add this crate to the `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
packageurl = "0.5.0"
```

Parse a string containing a raw PURL using the
[`FromStr`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/str/trait.FromStr.html) trait:

```rust
use std::str::FromStr;
use packageurl::PackageUrl;

fn example() {
    let purl = PackageUrl::from_str("pkg:cargo/packageurl@0.3.0");
}
```

Creating a PURL from Rust and then generating a string representation using:
the [`ToString`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/string/trait.ToString.html) trait:

```rust
use std::string::ToString;

fn example() {
    let canonical = package::PackageUrl::new("cargo", "packageurl")
        .expect("only fails if type is invalid")
        .with_version("0.3.0")
        .to_string();
}
```

`serde` serialization and deserialization is also supported, provided the
`serde` feature is enabled:

```toml
[dependencies]
packageurl = { version = "0.5.0", features = ["serde"] }
```

See more in the [online documentation](https://docs.rs/packageurl/).

## 📝 Features

- `memchr`: use the [`memchr`](https://docs.rs/memchr/) crate to locate
  separator when parsing.
- `serde`: enable serialization and deserialization support with the
  [`serde`](https://docs.rs/serde) crate.
